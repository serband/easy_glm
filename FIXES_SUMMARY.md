# easy_glm Package Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the `easy_glm` package installation issues with Python 3.13.

## Problem Identified

The package was failing to install on Python 3.13.5 due to dependency version conflicts:
- `llvmlite==0.36.0` only supports Python versions >=3.6 and <3.10
- The dependency chain was: `dask-ml` → `numba` → `llvmlite==0.36.0`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated requirements.txt

Changed from:
```txt
dask-ml>=1.0.0
```

To:
```txt
dask-ml>=2025.1.0
numba>=0.61.0
llvmlite>=0.44.0
```

This ensures compatibility with Python 3.13 by using newer versions of the problematic dependencies.

### 2. Fixed example script parameter name

In `examples/basic_usage.py`, changed:
```python
DivideTargetByWeight=True
```

To:
```python
divide_target_by_weight=True
```

### 3. Updated README.md

Fixed the example code in README.md to use the correct parameter name:
```python
divide_target_by_weight=True
```

### 4. Verified all changes

- All tests pass successfully
- Example script runs correctly
- Package can be imported and used without issues
- Installation script works correctly

## Root Cause

The `pyproject.toml` file had already been updated with compatible versions for Python 3.13, but the `requirements.txt` file was still using outdated specifications that resolved to incompatible versions.

## Solution

By updating the `requirements.txt` file to match the dependency versions in `pyproject.toml`, we ensure that:
1. All dependencies are compatible with Python 3.13
2. The installation process uses the correct versions
3. The package works as expected

## Testing

All changes have been verified by:
1. Running the setup script successfully
2. Running all tests (4/4 passed)
3. Running the example script successfully
4. Creating and running a comprehensive installation verification script
